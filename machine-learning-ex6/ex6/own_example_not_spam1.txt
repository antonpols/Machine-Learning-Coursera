Hi Nandini,

How is it going? :) My internship is coming to its end, so I think it is a good idea to already schedule our final meeting. According to the internship guidelines, we have to have a final meeting to fill in the review form and for you to give feedback on my internship and report.

I propose to schedule the meeting in the week from 28 November to 2 December, preferably at the end of the week (Thursday/Friday). This would be ideal for me, as in that case I can wrap up all the remaining work at ASML before that meeting and then I will be done with my internship (and Masters) directly after our review meeting :) If this week is no good for you, we can schedule the meeting the week after or the week thereafter (officially the meeting has to take place within two weeks after the end date of my internship). The meeting will of course be in Delft, so you will not have to travel to ASML.

There will also be a final review session at ASML with my supervisor and manager. You are of course invited for this review session as well, but it is not mandatory for you to be there :) If you are interested to join, let me know and I will fill you in with the details. This meeting still has to be officially planned, but it probably will be in the last week of my internship as well (28 November to 2 December) or the week before that.

Lastly, I just finished writing my public report, which is the one you should be grading me on. Now, it has to be reviewed by my manager and some publications office, this will approximately take 3 weeks. When it is cleared by the publications office, I will send this report to you, so you can already review it before our meeting.


Let me know what best suits you!

Kind regards,
Anton

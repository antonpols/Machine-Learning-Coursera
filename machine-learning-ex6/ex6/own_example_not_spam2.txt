Hi again,

Great|, I'll let you know as soon as things start moving on this project.

Not sure you have to wait to chat to Olja though, as she won't be quizzing you on the material. I just thought it might be nice to hear what she thinks of it, coming out of (astro) physics and all. She already said she'd be happy to speak to you, and just let me know and I'll hook you up. Now, or in 11 weeks, it is all up to you.

Cheers,
Martin
